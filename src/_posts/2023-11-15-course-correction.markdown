# TL;DR;

A couple of months ago I announced my plan to go independent and pivot into providing consulting services. At that time 
I operated on a rather optimistic view of the state of the market. Reality turned out to be less so. Hence, a course 
correction was necessary.

Without further ado I'm happy to announced that, as of November 2023, **I have joined the Streamlit Ecosystem team 
at Snowflake.**

# Why Snowflake?

Snowflake is all about data. It is literally their mission statement to "Mobilize the world's data". And the world runs 
on data. At least this is what the AI/ML maximalists want you to believe! That's one of the reasons I think Snowflake 
is the place to be. When all the hot air of the current hype cycle ends, it will be tools like Snowflake that will 
enable AI to do some actual work. 

Secondly, I'm super excited about the team I'm joining. If you didn't hear about Streamlit yet, it is open-source tool 
for creating web-apps with a focus on visualizing and interacting with data. In my opinion a crucial piece of the data 
puzzle. The company behind Streamlit was acquired by Snowflake in 2022. Consequently, a lot of work is 
currently going into integrating it into the Snowflake Data Platform.

Finally, the Snowflake Warsaw hub was build on top of Polidea. A company I worked for between 2009 and 2017. I have met
a lot of fantastic people during that time. Many of them are still at Snowflake. I believe this combination of great 
people and an interesting products, creates a truly potent mix.

# Continued commitment

Even with this course correction, I remain committed to developing CitroVM further and writing this blog. Although its 
focus may shift from Apple platforms into the broad python ecosystem. 

**Let it snow!**
